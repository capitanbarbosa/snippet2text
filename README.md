# Snippet 2 Text - OCR

Grabs the latest image from the clipboard (any snip from the screen), transforms it to text, and places the text inside the clipboard ready to be pasted, in milliseconds.

There is also a version with a Regexp added, which removes any special characters from the extracted string, and is useful for transferring data such as id's, codes, etc.
